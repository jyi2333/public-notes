## Markdown Settings in VSCode
Not purely standard markdown files, so you might need following extensions to view it.
* [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
* [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)

To preview it, use `Ctrl + K, V`, type `Ctrl + K` , then seperately `V`, not at once (not `Ctrl + K + V`)
