## Markdown Settings in VS Code
Not purely standard markdown files, so you might need following extensions to view it.
* [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
* [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)

To preview it, use `Ctrl + K, V`, type `Ctrl + K` , then seperately `V`, not at once (not `Ctrl + K + V`)

## Notes during Capstone in[Linux notes](https://github.com/jyi2333/public-notes/tree/main/Linux%20notes)

*personal notes during capstone project and WS2022, in case I forget some commands and configuration stuff. So not only notes on RHEL8, also notes on Ubuntu (Pop!_OS), and maybe there will be notes on Arch (Manjaro) and Windows someday. Yeah, maybe also notes in other languages or about other softwares (vim, cmake, vulkan) on Linux etc. (just ignore them if they are useless to you)
